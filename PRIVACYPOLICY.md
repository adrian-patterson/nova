# Privacy Policy for Nova Browser

**Effective Date:** October 2, 2025

## Overview

Nova Browser is a minimalist web browser application designed for emergency web access while maintaining digital minimalism. This privacy policy explains our data collection and usage practices.

## Data Collection

**Nova Browser collects NO user data whatsoever.**

Specifically, we do not collect, store, or transmit:
- Personal information
- Browsing history
- URLs visited
- User behavior data
- Device information
- Location data
- Cookies or local storage
- Analytics data

## How the App Works

Nova Browser operates as a simple interface that:
1. Accepts URL input from the user
2. Opens the URL in the device's native Safari web browser component
3. Clears the URL input when the browser session ends

The app functions entirely on-device with no network connections for data collection purposes.

## Third-Party Services

Nova Browser uses the iOS native Safari View Controller (SFSafariViewController) to display web content. Any data handling within the Safari component is governed by Apple's Safari privacy policies, not by Nova Browser.

## Data Storage

Nova Browser:
- Does not store browsing history
- Does not save cookies or website data
- Clears all session data when the browser is closed
- Uses incognito/private browsing mode by default
